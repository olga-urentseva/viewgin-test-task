# Viewgin Test Task

## Launching

Save directory.
In this project I use [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) as a package manager. So install the dependencies with it:

```bash
yarn
```

Finally run the application!

```bash
yarn start
```

Now you can open [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200/) in browser!

## Technologies and libraries that I use in this project:
1. React
2. Pug
3. Vanilla JavaScript and CSS
4. Axios (for fetching data)
5. PropTypes (for declaration the types of props in React components)
6. ClassNames
7. Webpack
8. Apexcharts

### Used approaches:

1. Mobile first
2. Responsive design
3. Inclusiveness
